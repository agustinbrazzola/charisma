# Charisma as a Network

Once the tool is adopted and people start enjoying hanging out in Charisma, the platform should be populated enough to make users interact with each other. This is step is very hard to accomplish, due that social networks need a high level of network effects in order to be succesful. However, web 3 could enable that possibility if executed correctly.

## Social content behind the wallets

This feature brings the composability of other social networks and tie that data directly to economical behaviour. This concept is very powerful.

## Celebrity Tracking

People love celebrities and celebrities love to be featured. If the platform gets the attention of some of them, the word of mouth could be very powerful. 

## Wallet birthdays

Although this could be seen as a tool, it could also bring network effects. The fact of gifting an NFT for a birthday of the wallet could be a trend that drives adoption to the platform, and it should be very well thought when it's launched.
