# Value proposition

Reputation is important in any aspect of life. It's even more important in an anonymous framework where at some point we take leaps of faith on trusting parties.

Digital identities and great however also tricky. Anybody can change social profiles, and act as someone they aren't really. 

But we all know that. What I'll try to explain here, is the value Charisma could bring, against other platforms which coul've but didn't make it.

## The problem of Etherscan

When a user is onboarded on a platform, usually is redirected to a URL that creates an account, has some guide/documentation/tutorials on how to get the best experience of the product and if the platform is good it will bring a helper that inducts the behaviour on the user's first steps. 

Think about the first time you created your decentralized wallet. You probable spent sometime googling "create a metamask wallet", docs are not so straight forward and you probably had to ask somebody to send you funds. In my particular case, the person who onboarded me, once sent the eth, showed me Etherscan and explained that was the "database" where I could see funds flowing around.

I have a technical background and I struggled to understand it for several months. I still find new features that I think are highly valuable but nobody really explained us how to use it and it doesn't seem like the builders of Etherscan are trying to create an easy experience for users. Different is for developers. 

What happens here? When you have limited computational power you have to choose. Etherscan is already a heavy query machine, and it can't support millions of users executing a fancy UI.

However, Etherscan is a tool, but also could be a network. It would be the safest place to look for new projects, to message other wallets and visualising data. 

## This is not the first analytics tool

When I talk about data platforms here, I'm focusing on NFT platforms. DeFI is a more mature space that has a longer development on consuming data. Also, DeFI is not about personalities but explicitly about tools that provide yield or stability.

There are more data platforms than Etherscan, obviously. Most of them are following on investment purposes.

For the NFT space, most analytics platforms focus on investment purposes. They will analyse floor prices, amount of NFTs listed on certain collections and some of them will give you the possibility to follow wallet activity. But they are not about understanding reasons behind wallet, they are not really about understanding the users.

## What's the value of Charisma

We want to solve the problem Etherscan didn't tackle. We want to be the framework that allows to take data schemas other people or you created, and use it to measure the wallets you want.

We want to become that onboarding platform that makes everything simpler, that allows you to find people like yourself, or people you want to look like. We want to be interactive and become a place of connection between people.

We also want to provide services to business. We want to be able to be integrated by other parties, through our APIs. We want to build novel ways of interacting with NFTs that companies and protocols can spin and enrich their businesses with Charisma's network.
