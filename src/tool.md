# Charisma as a tool

There are two aspects about Charisma that can be considered a tool.

## Dashboard creator

We can build a framework that allows users to analyse data the way they want. They will be able to grab Charisma's trate and customize the min and max that qualify for that criteria. We will also would like to provide some raw data that gives a more analytical description of the wallet. For example: 30% Diamond hand influence, 50% downtrend.

## Wallet calendar

We can set calendars for a different set of dates we would like to track. 

Wallet birthdays. Wallet engagement dates. 1st NFT mint. 

## SDKs and APIs

A Charisma SDK could be developed to attract developers that want to integrate our business logic inside their platforms. 

Same with custom APIs we can create for different projects. For example, what's the common trait for your community.
